This is where files should be placed so that they are uploaded to the ESP8266 SPIFFS file system.

Note: Any directory (folder) structure may be used but all files will end up in a flat, single directory level file system in SPIFFS.

Enable SPIFFS by setting "DISABLE_SPIFFS = 0" in the project Makefile.
